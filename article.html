        <h4 class="article-author"></h4>
        <h4 class="article-date"></h4>
        <img src="images/sample-1.jpg" class="article-img" alt="">
        <p class="article-information">The Whoop 5.0, announced today, is a significant hardware and software update
          with
          subscription pricing that
          seems keen on broadening its appeal to a wider audience.When I reviewed the Whoop 4.0, I said it was a tracker
          that made sense for athletes, but not so much the average person. Between hyper-performance-focused features
          and
          a
          pricey $30 monthly subscription, it wasn’t as accessible as other health and fitness trackers. It seems like
          Whoop’s taken that feedback to heart with its new Whoop 5.0.Let’s start with hardware. There are two versions
          of
          the Whoop 5.0: the regular one and the Whoop MG (MG stands for medical grade). Both are seven percent smaller
          than
          the 4.0 tracker, and Whoop claims it now has 10 times the power efficiency for 14 days of estimated battery
          life.
          There’s also a new wireless charging pack that holds another 30 days of charge. Processing speed is also
          purportedly 60 percent faster, and the sensors capture data roughly 26 times per second. The main difference
          between the regular 5.0 and the MG is the latter has EKG capabilities. More on that in a bit.Aside from the
          main
          tracker, Whoop is also adding new straps (including leather) and options for its Whoop Body clothing, which
          allows
          you to slot the tracker into specially sewn pockets. This lets you wear Whoop to other occasions, including
          formal
          events where a sporty tracker might not fit the dress code. The bad news is Whoop 4.0 straps are not
          interchangeable, though Whoop said in a press briefing that there will be an upcycling kit option for folks
          who
          upgrade.The bulk of the updates are software-based. On top of a streamlined app design, Whoop is introducing
          several new health features and metrics: a new longevity metric called Healthspan, FDA-cleared EKGs to detect
          atrial fibrillation and enable irregular heart rhythm notifications, blood pressure insights, hormonal
          insights
          for women, and a new experimental beta program called Whoop Advanced Labs. Those are just new features — Whoop
          says it’s also revamped sleep tracking with an update to Sleep Score, haptic alarms, and bedtime
          recommendations.Healthspan takes nine metrics to show how well users are aging physiologically compared to
          their
          chronological age. Aside from giving users a “Whoop Age” to represent this, the app will also offer tips on
          how
          daily habits impact the score. It’s a similar thought process behind blood pressure insights, which will
          require
          calibration with a cuff to get estimated readings and guidance. (Whoop says blood pressure is purely meant to
          be
          a
          wellness feature, and therefore doesn’t require medical clearance.) This is similar to recent metrics we’ve
          seen
          from Oura and Samsung, though those were specific to cardiovascular and metabolic health, respectively.
          Hormonal
          insights for women takes cycle tracking a step further, giving guidance regarding how hormones may influence
          recovery, sleep, stress, and performance during menstruation, pregnancy, or perimenopause. The EKG feature is
          relatively straightforward, it’s just a first from Whoop.Whoop Advanced Labs is the most dramatic new health
          feature. It won’t be available at launch — there’s currently a waitlist — but it will allow Whoop users to
          schedule blood tests reviewed by clinicians. Those results can be viewed in the Whoop app alongside other
          metrics.
          When it is launched, Whoop Advanced Labs will also require an extra charge outside of the monthly
          subscription.Speaking of which, Whoop is redoing its subscription model. Previously, Whoop’s subscriptions
          were
          either a family membership, and a 12- or 24-month commitment period. Now, Whoop is dividing subscription tiers
          based on price and feature set. The entry-level Whoop One tier costs $199 annually, includes Whoop 5.0
          hardware,
          a
          wired charging pack, and the basic fitness tracking metrics plus AI coaching. The mid-tier Whoop Peak
          subscription
          costs $239 annually (same as the current 12-month subscription). It includes everything on Whoop One, plus the
          new
          Healthspan metric, stress tracking, a wireless charger, and the Health Monitor dashboard for viewing your
          metrics.
          The premium Whoop Life subscription costs $359 a year, adds in EKGs and blood pressure insights, and comes
          with
          the Whoop MG hardware.While some of these changes are bound to rile up existing users, they make sense when
          considering what Whoop is up against.Smart rings are increasingly encroaching on Whoop’s territory for sleep
          and
          recovery tracking. It’s also difficult to pull hardcore athletes fully away from their Garmin, Suunto, and
          Coros
          watches. Meanwhile, the average user likes that Apple, Google, and Samsung watches can do more than track
          health
          thanks to their screens, something Whoop deliberately avoids.If it wants to grow, Whoop has to appeal to more
          than
          a niche subset of fitness tracker users while making its subscription plans more palatable. The question is
          whether this mix of features, hardware, and subscriptions is the right one for the masses — a thing I’ll be
          evaluating as I try out the Whoop 5.0 over the next month. But in the event you don’t feel like waiting, you
          can
          order the Whoop 5.0 starting today.</p> -->
